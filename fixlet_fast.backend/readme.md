The Journey of Building Fixlet Fast:

1. Backend Setup & Tool Integration
Start by setting up the backend for the Fixlet Fast application, integrating necessary tools and libraries to handle API requests and manage the database.
Ensure proper database connectivity and define essential endpoints for the application.


2. Database Structure & Model Planning
Plan the table structure and establish relationships between models.
Think about the entities like User, Service, Booking, and Cart to ensure smooth interaction between them.
Key Points to Remember:
Dev Dependencies: These are used in the development phase (e.g., testing frameworks, linting tools).
Dependencies: These are used by the application in both development and production (e.g., express, mongoose).
Middleware (app.use): Used for routing, authentication, and logging, essential for controlling the flow of requests.


3. Frontend Development: Login & Registration with Redux
Create the login and registration pages with form validation.
Use Redux for managing authentication state across the app.


4. Dashboard Design
Design the dashboard to show user-specific information like booking history, upcoming services, and relevant actions (book a service, manage profile, etc.).


5. Service Data Collection & UI Rendering
Collect service data from the backend and display it in the frontend using Redux for state management. Make sure data is fetched dynamically from the backend and displayed accordingly.


6. User Booking, Cart, and Other Features
Work on implementing user bookings, cart functionality, and related features. This will involve creating backend APIs for handling service bookings and storing them in the database.

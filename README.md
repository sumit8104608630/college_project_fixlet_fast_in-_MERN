🌟 The Journey of Building Fixlet Fast 🌟

1. Backend Setup & Tool Integration ⚙️
Start by setting up the backend for the Fixlet Fast application, integrating necessary tools and libraries to handle API requests and manage the database.
Ensure proper database connectivity and define essential endpoints for the application.


2. Database Structure & Model Planning 🗂️
Plan the table structure and establish relationships between models.
Think about the entities like User, Service, Booking, and Cart to ensure smooth interaction between them.
Key Points to Remember:
Dev Dependencies: These are used in the development phase (e.g., testing frameworks, linting tools). 🛠️
Dependencies: These are used by the application in both development and production (e.g., express, mongoose). 📦
Middleware (app.use): Used for routing, authentication, and logging, essential for controlling the flow of requests. 🔐


3. Frontend Development: Login & Registration with Redux 🔑
Create the login and registration pages with form validation.
Use Redux for managing authentication state across the app. 🔄


4. Dashboard Design 🖥️
Design the dashboard to show user-specific information like booking history, upcoming services, and relevant actions (book a service, manage profile, etc.).


5. Service Data Collection & UI Rendering 📊
Collect service data from the backend and display it in the frontend using Redux for state management.
Make sure data is fetched dynamically from the backend and displayed accordingly. 📡


6. User Booking, Cart, and Other Features 🛒
Work on implementing user bookings, cart functionality, and related features.
This will involve creating backend APIs for handling service bookings and storing them in the database. 📝

7.API Error Handling & Validation 🛡️
Implement comprehensive error handling and validation for API requests to ensure that users receive clear and actionable error messages. This includes validating user inputs, handling database errors, and ensuring the security of API endpoints. 🚧
With the cart functionality completed, users can now seamlessly add services, update their cart, and proceed to checkout. Let me know if you need any further assistance on this journey!
